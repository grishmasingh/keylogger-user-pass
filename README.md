# Keylogger ðŸ’» ðŸ”‘:


<h2>Project Overview</h2>

**!DISCLAIMER! This is a cybersecurity project done for educational purposes so please do use it sensibly**

I created this project for internal use to illustrate and raise awareness of the importance in installing anti-virus protection software's. I have relatives who are very inexperienced with Computers so I decided to create a keylogger script that extracts the any platforms that contains a username and password field and translates it into a log.txt file.

These scripts are very common in computers that are not protected or updated and through this project , I was able to show my family about how keylogger works and the consequences it brings.
